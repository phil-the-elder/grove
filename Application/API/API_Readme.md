The core code for Grove is structured by classes, with the Game class being the principal engine for the application. In addition, there are main classes for Item, Map, and Creature (with inheriting subclasses stored inside their respective files) and helper classes, CombatManager and DBManager. 

All code contains docstrings that comply with Pep-8 standards.
