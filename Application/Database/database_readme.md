# Database

Grove is served by an RDBMS structure currently supported by SqlLite. There are currently two databases housed inside the Database folder - a main database and a template database. When a new game is created, a copy of the template database is loaded into the main db, to represent the new game. 
This structure will be replaced by a python function in a later release.
